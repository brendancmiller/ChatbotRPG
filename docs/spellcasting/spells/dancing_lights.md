# Dancing Lights 
_Evocation cantrip_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Within 2 locations away   
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light througout your location.    
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights to an adjoining room. A light must be no further than 2 locations away, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
