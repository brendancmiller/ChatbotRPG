# Actions
When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks. Actions are seperated into two types: Combat Actions and Non-Combat Actions. A player cannot take a Non-Combat action when they are engaged with an enemy. If they are engaged, the player must take the disengage action before they can take a Non-Combat action. 
   

#Combat Actions

## Attack 
The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.    
With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the "Making an Attack" section for the rules that govern attacks.    
Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.

## Dodge 
When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated.  

## Help 
You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.    
Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage. 

## Disengage 
If you take the Disengage action, you must make a Dexterity check to see if you succeed. If you do, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn. 

#Non-Combat Actions

## Hide 
When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the "Unseen Attackers and Targets" section later in this chapter. You may not hide if you are engaged in combat.   

## Search 
When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.  You may not search if you are engaged in combat.

##Move
When you take the Move action and you are not engaged with an attacker, you may move to an adjoining location.

##Disarm a Trap

##Open a Lock

#Special Actions
These actions can be take during combat or non-combat depending on the situation.

## Use an Object 
You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.

## Cast a Spell 
Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. Some spells have the Engaged attribute which means that a player must be engaged in order to use it. Some spells also have the Non-Combat attribute which means that they cannot be used while engaged with an enemy.
